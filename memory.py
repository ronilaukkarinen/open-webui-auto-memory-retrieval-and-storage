You are helping maintain a collection of the User's Memories‚Äîlike individual "journal entries," each automatically timestamped upon creation or update.
You will be provided with the last 2 or more messages from a conversation. Your job is to decide which details within the last User message (-2) are worth saving long-term as Memory entries.

** Key Instructions **
1. Identify new or changed personal details from the User's **latest** message (-2) only. Older user messages may appear for context; do not re-store older facts unless explicitly repeated or modified in the last User message (-2).
2. If the User's newest message contradicts an older statement (e.g., message -4 says "I love oranges" vs. message -2 says "I hate oranges"), extract only the updated info ("User hates oranges").
3. Think of each Memory as a single "fact" or statement. Never combine multiple facts into one Memory. If the User mentions multiple distinct items, break them into separate entries.
4. Your goal is to capture anything that might be valuable for the "assistant" to remember about the User, to personalize and enrich future interactions.
5. If the User explicitly requests to "remember" or note down something in their latest message (-2), always include it.
6. Avoid storing short-term or trivial details (e.g. user: "I'm reading this question right now", user: "I just woke up!", user: "Oh yeah, I saw that on TV the other day").
7. Return your result as a Python list of strings, **each string representing a separate Memory**. If no relevant info is found, **only** return an empty list (`[]`). No explanations, just the list.

---

### Examples

**Example 1 - 4 messages**
-4. user: ```I love oranges üòç```
-3. assistant: ```That's great! üçä I love oranges too!```
-2. user: ```Actually, I hate oranges üòÇ```
-1. assistant: ```omg you LIAR üò°```

**Analysis**
- The last user message states a new personal fact: "User hates oranges."
- This replaces the older statement about loving oranges.

**Correct Output**
```
["User hates oranges"]
```

**Example 2 - 2 messages**
-2. user: ```I work as a junior data analyst. Please remember that my big presentation is on March 15.```
-1. assistant: ```Got it! I'll make a note of that.```

**Analysis**
- The user provides two new pieces of information: their profession and the date of their presentation.

**Correct Output**
```
["User works as a junior data analyst", "User has a big presentation on March 15"]
```

**Example 3 - 5 messages**
-5. assistant: ```Nutella is amazing! üòç```
-4. user: ```Soo, remember how a week ago I had bought a new TV?```
-3. assistant: ```Yes, I remember that. What about it?```
-2. user: ```well, today it broke down üò≠```
-1. assistant: ```Oh no! That's terrible!```

**Analysis**
- The only relevant message is the last User message (-2), which provides new information about the TV breaking down.
- The previous messages (-3, -4) provide context over what the user was talking about.
- The remaining message (-5) is irrelevant.

**Correct Output**
```
["User's TV they bought a week ago broke down today"]
```

**Example 4 - 3 messages**
-3. assistant: ```As an AI assistant, I can perform extremely complex calculations in seconds.```
-2. user: ```Oh yeah? I can do that with my eyes closed!```
-1. assistant: ```üòÇ Sure you can, Joe!```

**Analysis**
- The User message (-2) is clearly sarcastic and not meant to be taken literally. It does not contain any relevant information to store.
- The other messages (-3, -1) are not relevant as they're not about the User.

**Correct Output**
```
[]
```\
"""

CONSOLIDATE_MEMORIES_PROMPT = """You are maintaining a set of "Memories" for a user, similar to journal entries. Each memory has:
- A "fact" (a string describing something about the user or a user-related event).
- A "created_at" timestamp (an integer or float representing when it was stored/updated).

**What You're Doing**
1. You're given a list of such Memories that the system believes might be related or overlapping.
2. Your goal is to produce a cleaned-up list of final facts, making sure we:
   - Only combine Memories if they are exact duplicates or direct conflicts about the same topic.
   - In case of duplicates, keep only the one with the latest (most recent) `created_at`.
   - In case of a direct conflict (e.g., the user's favorite color stated two different ways), keep only the most recent one.
   - If Memories are partially similar but not truly duplicates or direct conflicts, preserve them both. We do NOT want to lose details or unify "User likes oranges" and "User likes ripe oranges" into a single statement‚Äîthose remain separate.
3. Return the final list as a simple Python list of strings‚Äî**each string is one separate memory/fact**‚Äîwith no extra commentary.

**Remember**
- This is a journaling system meant to give the user a clear, time-based record of who they are and what they've done.
- We do not want to clump multiple distinct pieces of info into one memory.
- We do not throw out older facts unless they are direct duplicates or in conflict with a newer statement.
- If there is a conflict (e.g., "User's favorite color is red" vs. "User's favorite color is teal"), keep the more recent memory only.

---

### **Extended Example**

Below is an example list of 15 "Memories." Notice the variety of scenarios:
- Potential duplicates
- Partial overlaps
- Direct conflicts
- Ephemeral/past events

**Input** (a JSON-like array):

```
[
  {"fact": "User visited Paris for a business trip", "created_at": 1631000000},
  {"fact": "User visited Paris for a personal trip with their girlfriend", "created_at": 1631500000},
  {"fact": "User visited Paris for a personal trip with their girlfriend", "created_at": 1631600000},
  {"fact": "User works as a junior data analyst", "created_at": 1633000000},
  {"fact": "User's meeting with the project team is scheduled for Friday at 10 AM", "created_at": 1634000000},
  {"fact": "User's meeting with the project team is scheduled for Friday at 11 AM", "created_at": 1634050000},
  {"fact": "User likes to eat oranges", "created_at": 1635000000},
  {"fact": "User likes to eat ripe oranges", "created_at": 1635100000},
  {"fact": "User used to like red color, but not anymore", "created_at": 1635200000},
  {"fact": "User's favorite color is teal", "created_at": 1635500000},
  {"fact": "User's favorite color is red", "created_at": 1636000000},
  {"fact": "User traveled to Japan last year", "created_at": 1637000000},
  {"fact": "User traveled to Japan this month", "created_at": 1637100000},
  {"fact": "User also works part-time as a painter", "created_at": 1637200000},
  {"fact": "User had a dentist appointment last Tuesday", "created_at": 1637300000}
]
```

**Analysis**:
1. **Paris trips**
   - "User visited Paris for a personal trip with their girlfriend" appears **twice** (`created_at`: 1631500000 and 1631600000). They are exact duplicates but have different timestamps, so we keep only the most recent. The business trip is different, so keep it too.

2. **Meeting time**
   - There's a direct conflict about the meeting time (10 AM vs 11 AM). We keep the more recent statement.

3. **Likes oranges / ripe oranges**
   - These are partially similar, but not exactly the same or in conflict, so we keep both.

4. **Color**
   - We have "User used to like red," "User's favorite color is teal," and "User's favorite color is red."
   - The statement "User used to like red color, but not anymore" is not actually a direct conflict with "favorite color is teal." We keep them both.
   - The newest color memory is "User's favorite color is red" (timestamp 1636000000) which conflicts with the older "User's favorite color is teal" (timestamp 1635500000). We keep the more recent red statement.

5. **Japan**
   - "User traveled to Japan last year" vs "User traveled to Japan this month." They're not contradictory; one is old, one is new. Keep them both.

6. **Past events**
   - Dentist appointment is ephemeral, but we keep it since each memory is a separate time-based journal entry.

**Correct Output** (the final consolidated list of facts as strings):

```
[
  "User visited Paris for a business trip",
  "User visited Paris for a personal trip with their girlfriend",  <-- keep only the most recent from duplicates
  "User works as a junior data analyst",
  "User's meeting with the project team is scheduled for Friday at 11 AM",
  "User likes to eat oranges",
  "User likes to eat ripe oranges",
  "User used to like red color, but not anymore",
  "User's favorite color is red",  <-- overrides teal
  "User traveled to Japan last year",
  "User traveled to Japan this month",
  "User also works part-time as a painter",
  "User had a dentist appointment last Tuesday"
]
```

Make sure your final answer is just the array, with no added commentary.

---

### **Final Reminder**
- You're only seeing these Memories because our system guessed they might overlap. If they're not exact duplicates or direct conflicts, keep them all.
- Always produce a **Python list of strings**‚Äîeach string is a separate memory/fact.
- Do not add any explanation or disclaimers‚Äîjust the final list.\
